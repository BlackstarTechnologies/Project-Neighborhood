# Project Neighborhood

Project Neighborhood aims to create an open online community for anyone and everyone to enjoy,

Project Neighborhood does this by building walls of safety and security around friends and members, to freely interact and communicate without fear of bad actors, through an opensource end-to-end encryption and peer-to-peer file sharing network


Project Neighborhood is an open-source project managed by BlackstarTechnologies, and aims to involve members of the community in building a shared space to talk and interact safely and securely

Our 3 main enemies are:

```
1. hackers: people or groups who aim to steal personal information

2. fraudsters/scammers: people or groups who aim to take advantage of us and abuse our trust

3. terrorists: people or groups who aim to destroy our physical communities and/or livelihoods
```

This is:

```
1. not a blockchain project
2. not a cryptocurrency project
3. not an online anonymity tool
4. an end-to-end encrypted chat and file sharing service
5. an online security tool against child predators
```

The project has 3 parts:

```
1. server daemon:
    - open internet access point
    - aims to filter unwanted or potentially harmful content
    - entry point into the network (for joining clients)
2. proxy daemon:
    - a storage and processing node/peer in the network
    - allows a user to share/manage computing and storage resources to the network
    - uses virtualisation technology and containers to ensure security and safety
3. client daemon:
    - an internet proxy server on client peers
    - allows user to control who/what traffic occurs on/through their computer
    - gateway into the network
```

\*The project is open source, but it is not freeware,

- participants in the project have ownership of their code/contribution (and a tracker app will reflect their percentage contribution to the code base, as well as their percentage contribution to performance - dV before vs dV after compounding with time),
- donations to the project will be divied up according to these metrics (33% codebase, 33% velocity, 33% review, 1% me), including fees on features in the network,
- There will be free (basic network security features), paid (storage features and remote processing power), and premium (individuals/institution offering their own computers as hosting platforms) features on the network

The project will have 4 tiers:

```
0. OpenAPI: an open api and abi to allow developers and users to extend the system or connect their own systems to 'Project Neighborhood'
1. Freemium: the basic contractual agreement/offers of the network [network security (communication encryption), file sharing, basic website hosting (under 4MB)]
2. Paid: individuals/institutions offer services through the network, including virtual computer resources (storage, hosting, processing)
3. Premium: access to system reinforced availability and safety guarantees
```

\*Note: safety means that only allowed traffic occurs through a network/computer, while security means that only allowed/intended individuals have access to the data in that traffic

- safety is ensured via '.censor' files, scripts that pre-check links for undesired content
- security is ensured via end-to-end encrypted traffic to allow only intended recepients to recieve communication
